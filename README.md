# Power-Iteration-Function-Spanish-
The Power Iteration is an algorithm which finds the highest possible eigenvalue of a diagonalizable matrix, as well as an eigenvector of A, which is a nonzero vector, and of course it's corresponding eigenvector. This method proves highly efficient in finding the biggest eigenvalue and consequently eigenvector of a matrix, no matter the size.
